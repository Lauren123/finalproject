<h2>What is a Forum?</h2>

<p>A forum is a page where you can post questions and get responses. This forum is to allow 
you to talk to other children your age who are living with diabetes!</p> You might want to 
ask other people your age what kind of sports they play or how they manage their diabetes.
This is an easy way to make knew friends or even just discuss your favourite tv show!! The 
image below shows what the forum looks like!
