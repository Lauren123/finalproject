<h2><u>Carbohydrate Counting</u></h2>

<p> Why does your body need carbohydrates?</p>
<!--- some of the information below is from - http://www.diabetes.org.uk/Guide-to-diabetes/Managing-your-diabetes/Carb-counting/ --->
<p>Carbohydrates are the body's preferred source of energy. All carbs are broken down into
 glucose - essential fuel for the body, especially the brain. High-fibre carbohydrates such
 as whole grains and fruit play an important role in the health of the gut.</p>

Jack and Francesca both have diabetes. They have learned which foods that they like have 
 carbohydrates in them. Jack - "When I have a meal or snack I check how much carbohydrates 
 in the foods I'm eating.Then I can work out exactly how much insulin I need to take. 
 It's called counting carbohydrates".
