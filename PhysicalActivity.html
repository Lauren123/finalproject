<h3><u>Fun Physical Activity Games!! (For Parents or Teachers to Play with Kids!)</h3></u>
<td><p>WALL TO WALL</td></p>
<div id="answerDiv"  style="display:none;" class="answer_list" >

Find a space to run across from wall to wall or wall to fence. Start with a counting-go game, 
yelling the loudest "Go!" you can muster, where upon the children run from one wall and stop 
at the other. Run with different children each time. Count up to different numbers. Count down. 
Then challenge different ways to run. Tip toes? Knees high? Arms high? Circling? Swinging? 
Twisting? Zig-zag? Backwards? Jumping?

}

<td><p>THE BLOB
<div id="answerDiv2"  style="display:none;" class="answer_list" >
Establish boundaries. Start by calling yourself the Blob. Chase the children until you catch one.
That child then grabs your hand and becomes part of the Blob. Together, still holding hands, you 
catch others. The Blob grows larger with each capture. Only the outside free hands can tag. The
Blob may either tag or encircle its prey. One of the characteristics of the Blob is that it can 
split up in to different numbers of smaller Blobs, but there must be at least two to a Blob. When 
one, two, or three children are left, whichever you specify, the game ends. Those children unite 
and begin the next Blob.

Mouse and the Mouse is little but quick. The balls are handed from one child to the next as quickly as
 possible. Start the smaller ball, the Mouse, first and the larger one, the Cat, a few seconds later. 
 The adult can stand or sit in the middle to catch wayward balls.
