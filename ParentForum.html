<h2>Diabetes and Parenting</h2>
<!--- http://www.diabetes.co.uk/diabetes-and-parenting.html-->
<p>Being a parent of a child with diabetes can bring an awful lot to consider and the responsibility can be demanding. Remember, you are not alone - 20,000 children under the age of 15 have type 1 diabetes in the UK.</p>
<p>What diet should my son or daughter have? How will I manage his or her blood sugar levels? Will they get the right level care at school? How will my son or daughter cope with their own diabetes?</p>
<p>Diabetes UK answer these questions and more and if you need more advice we have a specific Diabetes Forum for Parents and Children.</p>
